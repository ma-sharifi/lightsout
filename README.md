## Multi depth Lights Out Game Assessment for BLTMS company
This is an assessment about kind of pattern matching.
The assessment consists of a backtrack solution for solving this problem.

## Introduction
THis problem solved by backtracking technique.

## Introduction of backtracking
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems (notably Constraint satisfaction problems or CSPs),
which incrementally builds candidates to the solution and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.

Conceptually, one can imagine the procedure of backtracking as the tree traversal. Starting from the root node, one sets out to search for solutions that are located at the leaf nodes. Each intermediate node represents a partial candidate solution that could potentially lead us to a final valid solution. At each node, we would fan out to move one step further to the final solution, i.e. we iterate the child nodes of the current node. Once we can determine if a certain node cannot possibly lead to a valid solution, we abandon the current node and backtrack to its parent node to explore other possibilities. It is due to this backtracking behaviour, the backtracking algorithms are often much faster than the brute-force search algorithm, since it eliminates many unnecessary exploration.

Backtracking as a tree search has three fundamental traits:
When faced with a choice, each possibility is explored recursively.
After trying one choice and before trying the next, the program state is restored back to exactly what it was before trying the first choice.
When itâ€™s clear an exploration path will not lead to a viable solution, the exploration of that path stops.

## The main features of this:
1. Break down the task into small task and will go on. When find there is no way to go, will return and restore the non result board.
2. Because every pieces related to previous one, I can not break them to small pieces. **Nor board and neither Pieces. I mean there is dependency here.
3. Because of 2 , wee nedd to find somthing different. Maybe Data Analytic algorithm to help us. We can map this problem to pattern matching
and use dome algorithm like Cross Entropy. We need something help us to anticipate or tell us about the result without goring deeper into the tree.

## Solution:
In order to know the whole matrix is zero, I summed all cells. If sum is equal zero it means the problem solved.
For the pieces more than 11 it takes more 1 hours. Why? Because the Order of this algorithm is `(M*N) Power of PiecesNo` ((M*N) ^ PiecesNo).

### How Algorithm works:
Travers all cells of matrix and place a piece on the board whenever it can. Then go for the next piece. If did not find a result, revert the change then continue again for the next cell.
```
 for (int row = 0; row < board.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < board[0].length; col++) {
           placePieceOnBoard
           if sumBoardMatrix(board) == 0 return;
           if (!solution) backtrack;
           else return true;
        }
 }
```
In this picture you can see how algorithm works.

###Library
I found some library for work with matrix.
Our problem is more about search not mathematical things in this algorithm.
